# Carnot-react-native-app
App developed through react native technology. 
Sample android build provided for demo. The code is also here which can be used for IOS build of app
Filter by district and village added. 
Sort by date and price also added. 

Cannot handle possible situations when there is no internet
Tried to reolve it with async storage by comparing the dates of stored value and values coming from API
but asyncstorage only accepts strings so couldnt save arrays in it
